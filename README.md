# RPG

Simple RPG game about collecting items and exploring the scene. It was made to learn more about 3D models and development of third-person games. Includes animated models, environment, trigger zones which can be open by special items, etc. Maybe later it will become something like survival game. Let's see.

Will be added soon.

Plans:
- develop the lore and the plot;
- add some NPS's and environment;
- expand the world;
